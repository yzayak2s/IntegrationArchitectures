## Prerequisites

 Access to a **MongoDB** server is necessary. If you don't have one already, you should download the community server at:

 ## Further nice links for supporting MongoDB
 
 A fully comprehensive MongoDB Tutorial (based on MongoDB 3.4) for Java:
 https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.4/driver/getting-started/quick-start/
 
 Installation guide for MongoDB:
 https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.4/driver/getting-started/installation/
 
 A nice tutorial for MongoDB with a nice introduction and installation guidelines:
 https://www.baeldung.com/java-mongodb
 
 SQL to MongoDB Mapping Chart – another nice page :-!!
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/
 
 There are obviously many tools for the administration of a MongoDB, but I personally like this one, since you find a lot of nice examples on how to define queries. Also, examples for JavaScript programs are given and well documented!

 One of the most mature tools for maintaining data in a MongoDB database is the MongoDB compass that can be downloaded for free (commercial version available): 
 https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
 
 Please keep in mind that MongoDB does not possess a JOIN-operator. Instead, a lookup-Operator can be used to aggregate two collections. Here you find a nice demo with explanations:

 In general, be aware that there are many solutions for defining a concrete query.
 
 A simplified programming model to use MongoDB in Java is given by the platform Spring Boot, which simplifies the programming effort dramatically:

 You need a CLI application? Here is another cool SpringBoot library that eases the implementation of an CLI:
